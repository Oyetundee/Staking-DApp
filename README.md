## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18**: UI framework
- **Vite**: Build tool and dev server
- **TailwindCSS**: Styling and design system
- **Wagmi**: React hooks for Ethereum
- **RainbowKit**: Wallet connection UI
- **Viem**: TypeScript interface for Ethereum
- **Ethers.js**: Ethereum library for contract interactions

### Key Components
- `WalletConnection`: Handles wallet connectivity and status
- `TokenMinting`: Manages token minting operations
- `StakingInterface`: Provides staking functionality
- `WithdrawalRewards`: Manages withdrawals and reward claims
- `DataDisplay`: Shows protocol statistics and positions

### Contract Integration
- Automated ABI management
- Real-time contract state synchronization
- Transaction status monitoring
- Error handling and user feedback
- Gas estimation and optimization

## Development

### Project Structure
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/          # React components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contracts.js         # Contract addresses and ABIs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.js            # Utility functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wagmi.js            # Wagmi configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.jsx             # Main application component
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.jsx            # Application entry point
```

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

## Security Considerations

- Always verify contract addresses before interacting
- Use testnet for development and testing
- Implement proper error handling for failed transactions
- Validate user inputs before sending transactions
- Monitor for smart contract vulnerabilities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MetaMask not connecting**
   - Ensure you're on the Sepolia testnet
   - Clear MetaMask cache and restart browser
   - Check if the site is allowed in MetaMask settings

2. **Transaction failing**
   - Ensure you have sufficient ETH for gas fees
   - Check if you have enough token balance
   - Verify contract approvals

3. **Data not updating**
   - Refresh the page
   - Check your network connection
   - Ensure you're connected to the correct network

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
